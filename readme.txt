Instruction:

1) Open the IDE to run .py file (spyder is preferred) and open the "dijkstra_mothishraj_venkatesankumararaj.py"

2) The code will ask for start and goal point coordinates (If anything other than int datatype is inserted the program will throw error, please re-run the program)

4) If the coordinates are in obstacle or exceeds map dimension the program will ask for the output after prompting the issue

5) Once valid coordinated is entered, wait for the program to create a map and use the algorithm and backtrack 

6) Once backtrack path generated the animation display will pop up in full-screen. 

7) A sample animation is provided with the file named as "output_full_screen.mp4" for full screeen and "output_small_screen.mp4" for window mode
